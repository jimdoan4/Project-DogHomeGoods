            <h2>A HISTORY ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>We know that a dog is much more than a dog — they’re a member of the family and a best friend for life.
                When the source of your new best friend has such a big impact on their health, behavior, and well-being,
                finding the right one should not be left to chance.</p>
            <p>That’s why we’re making it easy to connect with responsible, good breeders who have your and your new
                dog’s best interests at heart, so your pup has the best chance at a healthy and happy life.</p>
            <h4 class="p-3 text-center">What are our Community Standards?</h4>
            <p>Good Dog is on a mission to connect good with good to weed out the bad. In that pursuit, we have sought
                out and worked with some of the top academics and practitioners in the field to develop community
                standards, which are grounded in evidence-based research and backed by science. While there is no “one
                size fits all” for what makes a breeding program responsible, we are able to use our community standards
                to evaluate programs consistently. Every member of our community must pass our screening process and
                meet or exceed our community standards before joining Good Dog. Here’s how we do it.</p>
            <h4 class="p-3 text-center">Buyer Education and Policies</h4>
            <p>Responsible breeders spend a great deal of time with potential puppy buyers to help guide them into
                making an informed, responsible decision that is right for them. They also spend a great deal of time
                vetting potential buyers to make sure each dog will be a good fit for their new forever home as well as
                being transparent about their breeding program and practices. Responsible breeders do their best to
                ensure a smooth transition to their new home by providing all the information and resources necessary
                for new owners to be successful, responsible guardians for their new puppy.</p>
            <p>Perhaps most important of all, responsible breeders make a lifelong commitment to their dogs. They
                provide ongoing support to their owners and, should anything ever come up, Good Breeders will take back
                their dogs and/or help rehome them, for any reason. Responsible breeders are committed to keeping their
                dogs in their homes and out of the shelter system through education, screening of potential buyers and
                their policies.</p>
            <p>We developed our community standards regarding buyer education and policies by learning from our partner,
                Dr. Gayle Watkins, PhD, and her work with Avidog International, the world’s leading educational
                institution on responsible dog breeding and dog ownership. Dr. Watkins has also bred and/or shown over
                150 champions and is one of the only breeders to have been named “Breeder of the Year” by the American
                Kennel Club for multiple years.</p>
